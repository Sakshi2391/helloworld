# Hey,

I am new to git and have just started learning its functionality. 
It's just amazing like creating a repository, then creating a new branch which looks like the master branch initially and then making
edits into new branch and then committing changes which we call saved changes and there is also a commit message so the other dev can get to know what and why we made changes
